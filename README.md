From: Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd ed) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos


> This [textbook](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods and to present enough information about each method for readers to be able to use them sensibly. We donâ€™t attempt to give a thorough discussion of the theoretical details behind each method, although the references at the end of each chapter will fill in many of those details.

> The book is written for three audiences: (1) people finding themselves doing forecasting in business when they may not have had any formal training in the area; (2) undergraduate students studying business; (3) MBA students doing a forecasting elective. We use it ourselves for masters students and third-year undergraduate students at Monash University, Australia.

This repository contains my exercise solutions in the form of an RStudio project for this excellent time series forecasting learning resource.
